# EHGroupTagger

(Last updated on September 30, 2023, at 12:17 UTC)

EHGroupTagger is an abandoned solution, initially proposed by @Hnsr0327 / @HanakuroHakoniwa, but later deemed meaningless due to the existing name/tagging system being too chaotic, low-quality, and illogical. @Hnsr0327 decided to close this project (and release all the code) after re-evaluating its feasibility (and facing harsh criticism from @nasu).

## Self-criticism announcement (why it failed)

This solution once attempted to propose using {Artist Name, Doujinshi Name, Page Count} to determine each unique piece of content (Unique Content ID), and each unique content should share the same fetish tags. Then each doujinshi gallery would have unique content and additional special indicators. 

But why couldn’t it succeed?

1. Imagine a scenario where you are an EH user, a newcomer; without proper guidance, you might not fill in the correct artist name/doujinshi name, page count, or even align the brackets, making these “misnamed” galleries inherently unsuitable for this so-called new system;
2. Regarding “unique content should share the same fetish tags,” I have encountered at least 10 similar scenarios: a certain tag, in different translation versions of the same unique content, at least 70% received 100+ weight, and there were still one or two versions that got vetoed. Even the users themselves would argue, and the absurdity is that the veto only involves a specific translation version;
3. As an extension of (2), imagine a scenario where you have a Western cultural background (in this case, you are a cartoon audience), and you see the tag “f:futanari”. You might say: shouldn’t this be “f:shemale”? In fact, EH even came up with a [Know the Difference](https://ehwiki.org/wiki/Know_The_Difference) webpage to explain the differences between these fetishes.

## Contributions and Feedback

There’s no need for any additional contributions or feedback here. Once I’m done with any other more important matters in my lifetime, perhaps I’ll come back and delve deeper into this.
